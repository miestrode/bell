Bell is a work in progress programming langauge that compiles to MCfunction (Minecraft's language for creating datapacks).

The goal of Bell is to provide a higher level, smarter workflow for developers in MCfunction so they can write more code faster and better. To be able to reason about your program in a higher level, to see the big picture.

Bell is actively developed, but still isn't done. At the current state you **can** (FINALLY!) compile a program with Bell.

This README is going to be updated soon with more information about the language, and of things to come.
