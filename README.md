# The Bell programming language
Bell is personal project of mine, to create a simpler way to create datapacks in Minecraft. The standard system is called MCfunction (by Mojang, creators of Minecraft) comes alongside your Minecraft game, but it is verbose, complicated, and cannot be reasoned with simply.

It was created as a single-line command language (and it's fine at that), but is now used to write multline, multifile datapacks. It wasn't designed for that. It's like taking a series of bash commands and calling that a programming language.

## So where does Bell come in?
Well, since we have no way to modify MCfunction (without modding), the best we can do is mask it's verbosity. Sort of like assembly. A variety of projects like this already exist, and they're all really cool!

Bell was created since I wanted to experiment with creating a compiler and give my own spin on a MCfunction transpiler.

It should be noted that Bell is in early development, and at its current state shouldn't and **cant** be used for creating Minecraft datapacks.
